# Scunthorpe

Scunthorpe is a simple string profanity filter for GameMaker.

List of profanity words from: https://github.com/coffee-and-fun/google-profanity-words

### Quick Notes:
- Many of the profanities listed within this project have been modified to remove any unecessary variations or very uncommon words.
- This system *can* filter out leetspeak such as '@ss', but it was intentional to only filter out words that include letters, meaning '@55' (for ass) and '8008$' (for boobs) will not be censored.
- This isn't the perfect solution for filtering out profanity, nor probably is the most efficient. This was made in my free time because I couldn't find one that suited one of my projects.
